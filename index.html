<h1>Where are the roaches?</h1>
<p>Cockroaches are gross. They spread germs. They defecate on our silverware. They live in our kitchens, our bathrooms. They thrive on our garbage, our leftover food.  And in a city of 8 million, they can be anywhere. But where are they exactly?</p>

<p>Right now there's no up-to-date way to track roach infestations. But restaurant inspectors are on the look out for the 6-legged bugs all the time. This map shows where city health inspectors are reporting roach sightings on any given week.</p>

<p>Check back each week to find out the neighborhood with the highest number of roach infestations.</p>

<p>Sign up for the email to get a monthly snapshot of where the roaches are. And tell us your cockroach horror stories.</p>
